# Task
You are an exprt in high-performance computing, C and assembly. Please write a high-performance C function that implements a 6x8 kernel for multiplying a 6x256 matrix \( A \) and a 256x8 matrix \( B \), resulting in a 6x8 output matrix \( C \). 


# Context
Architecture: AVX2 vector extensions. 
Data-type: double 
Function-signature: `dgemm_avx2(double const *A, double const *B, double *C)`.
