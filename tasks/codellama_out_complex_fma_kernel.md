  The original code computes the dot product of two vectors, but with a twist: the first element of the first vector is multiplied by the second vector and subtracted from the result. To vectorize this operation using AVX2 instructions, we can use the following approach:

1. Load four elements of the first vector (a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]) into an __m256 variable using the _mm256_loadu_ps intrinsic function.
2. Load four elements of the second vector (B[j], B[j+1], B[j+2], B[j+3]) into another __m256 variable using the _mm256_loadu_ps intrinsic function.
3. Multiply the two vectors using the _mm256_mul_ps intrinsic function. This will give us the dot product of the first four elements of the two vectors.
4. Load the fourth element of the first vector (a[3]) into a single scalar variable using the _mm_cvtss_f32 intrinsic function.
5. Multiply the fourth element of the second vector (B[N-1]) by the scalar variable using the _mm_mul_ps intrinsic function. This will give us the dot product of the last four elements of the two vectors.
6. Add the results of steps 3 and 5 using the _mm256_add_ps intrinsic function to get the final result.
7. Store the final result in the destination array using the _mm256_storeu_ps intrinsic function.

Here is the vectorized code:
```c
#include <immintrin.h>

void func_3(float const* a, float const* B, float * C, int N)
{
    __m256 v1 = _mm256_loadu_ps(a);
    __m256 v2 = _mm256_loadu_ps(B);
    __m256 dotprod = _mm256_mul_ps(v1, v2);
    float a3 = _mm_cvtss_f32(_mm_extract_ps(v1, 3));
    float bN = _mm_cvtss_f32(_mm_extract_ps(v2, N-1));
    dotprod = _mm256_add_ps(dotprod, _mm256_mul_ps(a3, bN));
    _mm256_storeu_ps(C, dotprod);
}
```
This code should be faster than the original version, as it uses SIMD instructions to perform the multiplication and addition operations in parallel. The use of AVX2 instructions will also provide better performance on Haswell processors, which have a dedicated vector execution unit (VEX) for these instructions.
