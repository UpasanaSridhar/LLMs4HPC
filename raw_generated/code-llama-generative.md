```c
void dgemm(double const *A, double const *B, double *C) {
    int i, j, p;
    for (i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        for (j = 0; j < N; ++j) {
            C[i*N+j] = 0.0;
            for (p = 0; p < K; ++p) {
                C[i*N+j] += A[i*K+p] * B[p*N+j];
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This function implements a 6x8 kernel for multiplying a 6x256 matrix A and a 256x8 matrix B, resulting in a 6x8 output matrix C. The function uses a simple nested loop structure to iterate over the elements of the matrices, with each iteration computing the dot product of two rows of the matrices and adding it to the corresponding element of the output matrix.

The performance of this function can be improved by using optimized BLAS libraries that provide high-performance implementations of matrix multiplication operations. These libraries often use specialized algorithms and hardware acceleration to achieve high performance, making them much faster than the reference code provided in the context.
