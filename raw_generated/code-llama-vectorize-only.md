To vectorize this code, we can use the following approach:

1. Identify the innermost loop and determine if it can be vectorized. In this case, the inner loop is the addition of `A[i]` and `B[j]`.
2. Determine the data types and sizes of the arrays involved in the computation. In this case, we have `M` rows in `C`, `N` columns in `C`, `M` rows in `A`, and `N` columns in `B`.
3. Choose a SIMD instruction that can perform the desired operation on multiple elements at once. In this case, we want to add `A[i]` and `B[j]`, so we can use the `_mm256_add_pd()` intrinsic provided by AVX2.
4. Loop over the rows of `C` in a vectorized fashion, using the `for (int i = 0; i < M; i += 8)` loop syntax. In this case, we can use a vector length of 8 since `M` is a multiple of 8.
5. Inside the inner loop, load the elements of `A[i]` and `B[j]` into vector registers using `_mm256_load_pd()` and `_mm256_load_pd()`, respectively.
6. Perform the vectorized addition operation using `_mm256_add_pd()`.
7. Store the results of the vectorized addition back into `C` using `_mm256_store_pd()`.
8. Increment the loop variables appropriately for each iteration, taking care to respect the strides of the arrays.

Here's the resulting code:
```c
#include <immintrin.h>

void vectorized_add(double *A, double *B, double *C, int M, int N) {
    for (int i = 0; i < M; i += 8) {
        __m256d a = _mm256_load_pd(&A[i]);
        __m256d b = _mm256_load_pd(&B[j]);
        __m256d c = _mm256_add_pd(a, b);
        _mm256_store_pd(&C[i * N + j], c);
    }
}
```
This code uses the AVX2 instruction set and the `_mm256_` intrinsics to perform vectorized addition operations on the arrays `A`, `B`, and `C`. The resulting code is optimized for performance and can take advantage of the parallelism present in the innermost loop.
