Here is a possible implementation of the dgemm_avx2 function using AVX2 instructions:
```c
void dgemm_avx2(double const *A, double const *B, double *C) {
    // Get the number of rows and columns of A and B
    int m = 6;
    int n = 8;
    int k = 256;

    // Calculate the strides for each matrix
    int a_stride = 6 * k;
    int b_stride = k * n;
    int c_stride = m * n;

    // Define the AVX2 registers
    __m256d a, b, c;
    __m256i idx;

    // Loop over each row of C
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        // Calculate the address of the first element of the current row of C
        double *c_row = C + i * c_stride;

        // Initialize the AVX2 registers with the values of A and B for the current row
        a = _mm256_loadu_pd(A);
        b = _mm256_loadu_pd(B);

        // Loop over each column of C
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            // Calculate the address of the current element of the current row of C
            double *c_ij = c_row + j;

            // Perform the matrix multiplication using AVX2 instructions
            idx = _mm256_set_epi32(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7);
            a = _mm256_shuffle_pd(a, idx);
            b = _mm256_shuffle_pd(b, idx);
            c = _mm256_mul_pd(a, b);

            // Store the result in the current element of C
            *c_ij = _mm256_extract_epi32(_mm256_castpd_si256(c), 0);
        }
    }
}
```
This implementation uses AVX2 instructions to perform the matrix multiplication in parallel. The `a` and `b` registers are initialized with the values of A and B for the current row, respectively. Then, the `idx` register is used to shuffle the elements of `a` and `b` so that they can be multiplied together using the `_mm256_mul_pd` instruction. The result of the matrix multiplication is then stored in the current element of C using the `_mm256_extract_epi32` instruction.

Note that this implementation assumes that the matrices are stored in row-major order, with each row being contiguous in memory. If your matrices are stored in column-major order instead, you will need to modify the `a_stride`, `b_stride`, and `c_stride` variables accordingly.

Also note that this implementation assumes that the input matrices are stored as arrays of `double`s, which is the default data type for AVX2 instructions in C. If your matrices are stored as arrays of `float`s instead, you will need to modify the `_mm256_loadu_pd` and `_mm256_extract_epi32` instructions accordingly.
